# Build 10
- Added Apple Music and Deezer resolvers (metadata overlay + YouTube audio resolution).
- Blocked Apple Music playlist links with explicit “unsupported link” error.
- Spotify resolver now uses embed data + playlist expansion into per-track searches.
- Added playlist progress fields in download events (`item_index`/`item_count`).
- Added `debugmain.py` for readable, non-JSON debug logs.
